# Define a main.rb file that will require all the other files
# Use gets.chomp to get input from users and puts for output
# Isolate your Input/Output logic to one or two classes. Don't allow all your classes to interact (gets/puts) with the User
# Use puts, raise some_val.inspect, and byebug to help with debugging
